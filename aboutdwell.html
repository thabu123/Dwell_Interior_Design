Each piece of Dwell’s furniture is part of a journey…combined to create a world apart.The storefront expanded in 2008 to include a lower level—and the lower level was expanded again in 2011.  In 2017, Dwell doubled its storefront to offer over 14,000 square feet of fine home furnishings. Cheri serves as President, Jeff as Vice President and John as Vice President. Dwell Renovations was established in 2013 with Mike Pitlick from Knock On Wood, joining the team.  Dwell Kids opened in 2015 and brings a new and exciting concept to the Dwell Brand.
			Our company began in 1997 as a home furnishings franchise called Expressions Custom Furniture owned by Cheri Hochstetler.  The “Dwell Concept” was a vision of Cheri’s and brought to fruition in 2006 with the addition of partners Jeff Draker and John O’Meara.
			Dwell currently employs 22 people; it has a storefront at 250 12th Avenue and a warehouse at 2010 James Street, all in Coralville, Iowa.  The Dwell philosophy of Renew, Refresh and Excite lets you explore the multitude of texture and color including a wide variety of unique, traditional and eclectic styles.
